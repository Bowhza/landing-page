This is the repository for my landing page design built in html and css.
The elements on the page were positioned using flexbox and all the images were taken from Pexels, Pixabay and Unsplash,
which provide free-to-use images. All credit goes to the original creators of the images.
The imported font used in the page header (Lobster) was taken from DaFont.com.
